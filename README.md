# sql-finetune
- Fine tuning premai-io/prem-1B-SQL: brought execution rate up from 50% to 80% within 10 epochs/2 minutes of training.  Results don't yield the same answers, though!  Could be due to lack of knowledge about the prompt structure for premsql model, or perhaps the questions in the validation set need to be made clearer.
